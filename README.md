## Architecture (MVVM)

![API follows Domain Driven Design](http://www.newdesignfile.com/postpic/2011/07/iphone-contacts-app-icon_190593.jpg)

## Functionality

- Contact List View
- Add Contact
- Validate Password Entry

## Dependencies

- MVVMCross
- sql-net-pcl

# Android

Implemented solution.

# iOS

The requirements were for only one platform but to implment the same solution for iOS should be as simple as adding a reference to core, mvvmcross and adding a few view controllers. The only part of the solution that is not contained in core are the UI's.
